# Experimentum

## About

Experimentum is a playground project. I use it to test some interesting ideas mostly connected to computer graphics.

It's continuation of [Fractals project](https://github.com/jaccek/fractals) - but without fractals yet :)

## Dependences

* Linux/Unix OS
* Qt 5.7 (https://www.qt.io/)

Preferred way to compile project:

1. Go to main directory (it contains README.md).

1. Create folder: `build`.

1. Open terminal and go to `artifacts` folder.

1. Run `build.sh` script.

1. Compiled application should be in `artifacts` folder.
